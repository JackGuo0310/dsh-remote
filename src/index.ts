/**
 * dsh-remote-development — lightweight remote development for DeepSeek
 * Harness.
 *
 * Host half. One plugin row mounts the whole remote execution world:
 *   • `ctx.fs` — RoutingFileSystem: anchor paths (and registered remote
 *     roots) serve reads/writes/edits over SFTP; everything else delegates
 *     to the inherited sandboxed local backend, untouched.
 *   • `ctx.subprocess` — RoutingSubprocessRuntime: spawns with a cwd under an
 *     anchor run over the SSH exec channel; remote terminals refuse with a
 *     clear model-facing error (v1 scope).
 *   • `ctx.shell` — a routing executor keyed on the workdir: anchor paths run
 *     on the remote host's POSIX shell over SSH; local workdirs stay with the
 *     host platform's own sandboxed executor (bash on POSIX, pwsh on win32).
 *   • per-agent shell-tool visibility — a remote session sees the bash tool,
 *     a local session sees its platform's native tool, via scoped tool
 *     restrictions.
 *   • a session-scoped system-prompt section naming the remote root.
 *   • JSON routes for the Web client (machine registry + workspace picker).
 *
 * No model tools are added: the agent uses the SAME tools as a local
 * workspace, and the plugin translates execution to the remote host.
 * @module dsh-remote-development

 * Every service those classes read directly must appear here or the
 * ancestor-only fiber walk throws "cannot get property … without inject":
 *   • systemPrompt — the prompt section registers on it.
 *   • sandboxPolicy — both routing executors and SandboxedFileSystem read it.
 *   • sandbox — the routing executors wrap every local command through
 *     `ctx.sandbox.confine`; without the declaration the walk from this
 *     plugin's fiber reaches root and every shell call crashes (the incident
 *     behind the 2025-07 bash-tool outage).
 *   • agents — the per-agent cwd override and tool visibility enumerate live
 *     agents.
 * (`subprocess` is read by the local executor halves too, but this plugin
 * provides `ctx.subprocess` itself, so its own store satisfies the walk.)
